Attempting to create a monty hall problem simulation

Basically monty hall is like those game show where the contestant chooses 3 boxes or door
One of them hides the grand prize, while the other two would hide a not so good prize

`Let's say there's Box 1, Box 2, Box 3. The grand prize is inside the box 3.
The contestant first chooses Box 2. The host of the show would show Box 1 because it isn't the grand prize.
The host would again ask for the contestant's answer whether if the contestant still wants to keep the box or change the box
Whatever the contestant do, choose the not chosen box first, then reveal the box that the contestant have chosen. 
The game ends.`
